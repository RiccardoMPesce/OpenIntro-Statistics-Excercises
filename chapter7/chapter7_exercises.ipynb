    "* (a) First thing, we have to calculate the minumum distance between the two distributions in terms of standard deviation. This is computed as the sum between the _Z Score_ of $0.95$ multiplied by the _Standard Error_ (which is $1.96 \\times SE$) plus the _Z Score_ of 0.80 times the _Standard Error_ (that is $0.84 \\times SE$). This leads to $SE = \\frac{1 - 0}{2.84} = 0.35\\%$.\n",
    "* (b) We can easily see the _Margin of Error_ being $ME = 1.4\\%$, so from $ME = 1.96 * SE$ we derive $SE = \\frac{ME}{1.96} = 0.71$.\n",
    "* (c) Let's derive the ratio as $\\frac{SE_1}{SE_2} = \\frac{0.71}{0.35} = 2.03 => \\sqrt{\\frac{n_2}{n_1}} = 2.03 => \\frac{n_2}{n_1} = 4.12$. So we need a $4.12$ bigger sample size to shrink the standard error by $2.03$.\n",
