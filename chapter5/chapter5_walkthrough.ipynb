    "* (a) Let $p_{men}$ and $p_{women}$ the proportions of men paid more than women and women paid more than men, respectively. So, $H_{0} : p_{men} = p_{women}$ and $H_{A} : p_{men} \\ne p_{women}$.\n",
    "* (b) We find that $\\hat{p} = 0.904$ and $SE_{\\hat{p}} = 0.064$, which leads to $Z_{\\hat{p}} = 6.32$, holding a p-value of $P(Z \\gt |6.32|) = 2.62 \\times 10^{-10}$ which is way less than both 0.05 and 0.01, convincing us to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis according to which there is a gender wage gap."
