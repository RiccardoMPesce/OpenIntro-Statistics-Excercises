    "(a) $weight = 120.07 - 1.93 * parity$.\n",

    "### Exercise 9.6 - Cherry trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) The confidence interval is $[0.07,\\ 0.60]$, which means that the average change of volume and yield associated with an unitary change in height is between 0.07 and 0.60.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) According to the model, the cubic volume is 22.09 while the actual volume is 24.2, so the model is underestimating the volume by 2.1 cubic feet.\n",
