Then we have a discrete explanatory variable which is the year the observation is collected. The response variable is whether or not the preterm birth happened, and this is definitely a categorical variable. If we were to predict, let's say, how many weeks in advance the preterm occurred, then we would state that such variable would be ordinal."
