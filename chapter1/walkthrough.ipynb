From the previous exercise, we have a blocking variable which is sex, then we make the two initial blocks. One other blocking variable might be their performance levels, which can be categorized in discrete levels: this too can be a blocking variable since those who have higher grades might have a better attention. If we include people with learning disorders, we have to make the appropriate blocks. We also want to have a stratified sample, since we want to include students from different university courses. The sample size can vary from 500 to 1000. But given the broad scope of the study, we might even need to recruit more partecipants. Of course, I will not tell them the purpose of the study, so they will be blind. Music will be played in a way they might not realize (I might have them study in a coffee shop with a background music with/without lyrics). They have to be unaware of the fact that they are being studied to understand how music impacts their learning experience. I will let some researchers who are unaware of the treatment groups assess individual students knowledge."

Instead, they will have two letters: __A__ and __B__. Letter __A__ can represent the diet coke while __B__ can represent standard coke and vice versa, i.e. the letter is not tied to one or the other type of coke. Through a randomized Python script I will bind each student to the __A/B__ combination, and for each one of them the combination is different and randomly chosen.  "
